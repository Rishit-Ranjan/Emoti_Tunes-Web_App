# EmotiTunes Training Pipeline

This folder contains a scaffold for building a real Audio Emotion Recognition (AER) training pipeline.

## What this project needs

1. A real emotion dataset (audio and optionally image).
2. A preprocessing pipeline to extract features from audio.
3. A model training script.
4. A way to deploy the trained model to the browser or backend.

## Recommended datasets

> Always check each dataset's license and attribution requirements before using it in a project.

## Training pipeline overview

1. Download and unzip the dataset.
2. Preprocess audio:
   - convert to WAV
   - normalize sample rate
   - extract features like MFCCs, spectral centroid, zero crossing rate, energy
3. Train a classifier on emotion labels.
4. Save the model to `training/models/`.
5. Convert to TensorFlow.js if you want browser inference.

## How to use the script

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r training/requirements.txt
python training/aer_train.py --data-dir /path/to/dataset --output-model training/models/aer_model.h5
```

## Next step

- After training, export the model for browser use with `tensorflowjs_converter`.
- Then update `src/services/LocalMLService.js` to load the exported model instead of using synthetic weights.
